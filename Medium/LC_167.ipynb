        "\n",
        "The intuition for this is that we have 2 pointers left and right. We find the sum of elements at these two indices and then based on the sum, we move one of the pointers in either direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "So if the sum is more than our target, we have to decrease the summation, meaning move the right pointer 1 to left (since the array is in increasing order, the element to the left of right pointer is smaller, and we need the smaller value)\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, if the sum is less then our target value, we need to increase the summation. This basically means to move the left point by 1 to right.\n",
